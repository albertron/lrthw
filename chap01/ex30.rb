---STUDY DRILLS---
1. Try guess what elsif and else are doing
Elsif and else provide other branches to the if statement. if foo is true, performs first block, or if its not see if it falls 
true to elsif block, for everything else perform else block.

What happens if multiple elsif blocks are true?
Ruby starts and the top runs the first block that is true, so it will run only the first one  
=end

if cars > people && trucks > cars
  "Testing if branch one is correct"
elsif trucks < cars || people > cars
  "Testing branch two"
else
  "For everything else"
end
