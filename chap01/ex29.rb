---STUDY DRILLS---
1. What do you think the if does to the code under it?
If statement performs code "if" statement above it lies true. Skips it otherwise

2. Why does the code under the if need to be indented into two spaces?
Readability. Makes evaluating the code easier to recognise. Programmers know that this is a block of code

3. What happens if it isn't indented?
Nothing happens, code still works

4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the if-statement? Try it
(See below)

5. What happens if you change the initial values for people, cats, and dogs?
None of the cod changes, just the values that each variable holds so the statements may or may not be no longer true 
therefore may or may not print strings.
