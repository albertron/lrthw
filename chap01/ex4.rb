# STUDY DRILL
# ex.rb:14: undefined local variable or method 'carpool_capacity' for main:Object (NameError)

# On the current file, at line 14, there is a name error. The variable "carpool_capacity" has not been 
# defined and to fix this simply assign it.

# Variable space_in_a_car should be an integer rather than a float as you can't have half of a space in a car.
